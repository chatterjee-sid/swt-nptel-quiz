## As for the exam... some tips
* **Keep some time with yourself.** While the exam is usually quite easy, it's easier if you study with at least a week in hand.
* **Read all PPTs thoroughly.** While PPTs are not available always, you can use the transcripts instead. PPT screenshots are available there which you can use. You can find the transcripts [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1WnJdBnTbdoeJjsMx1cz40a4Z8Y0GTNhj). Although, not used at the last minute, but the [videos and books](https://nptel.ac.in/courses/106101163) can be downloaded offline here... in case you wish to use them on the go
* **Practice Assignment Questions.** The questions maybe different for you in your assignments. Try them, and try the questions here as well. You should be able to get an idea on how the questions can be asked.
  * You can create a markdown file of your own assignment questions, and convert them into a quiz using [**create_quiz.py**](https://github.com/chatterjee-sid/swt-nptel-quiz/blob/main/create_quiz.py).
* **Go through your notes.** But if you have not made any, you can also take AI help as well. I tried summarising every week's content using Gemini and it helped me a lot during preparation.

## About the exam
* The exam is of 180 minutes, and you will be allowed to leave the exam hall after the first 90 minutes only.
* But don't worry, sometimes the questions are so easy, that you can finish your exam in just 1 hour.
* There are a total of 50 questions in the test, divided in 3 sections of 20-20-10. All these question are mostly MCQ, but some may be MSQ (more than one correct) type as well.
* Every question is of 2 marks, so you will get a score out of 100 in Proctored exam. But this will be later converted to be out of 75 marks. 25 marks are for the assignments and **<span style='color: red;'>DON'T YOU DARE SKIP THE ASSIGNMENTS</span>** (you are allowed to skip only if you have 8 assignments with full score, yet you should attempt them for preparation).
* For the 25 marks of assignments, your best 8 assignments out of 12 will be considered. Try to score as many full scores in assignments as possible.
* Bonus: there's no negative marking. So attempt every question.

Lastly, confidence, and sufficient preparation is all you need in your exam... except don't forget to take important exam stuff like Hall ticket, pen, water bottle, ID card etc.

Good Luck!! ✨
